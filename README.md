# Visual-Polls-For-Twitch-and-Youtube-Streams

Creates a visual for polls you'd like to conduct on twitch. However, these questions need to be implemented in advance. There is no connection to the poll system within Twitch/Youtube

A Basic Demonstration: https://twitter.com/VGreenBanana/status/1680265478244298754?s=20

Once the program is running, the pygame window/first poll is started by typing +start into twitch/youtube chat

When a vote occurs, the visuals will update to show the change
